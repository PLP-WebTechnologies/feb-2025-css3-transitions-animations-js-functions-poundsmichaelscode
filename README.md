# CSS3 Animations and JavaScript User Preferences

This project demonstrates a simple interactive web page that uses **CSS3 animations** and **JavaScript functions** to enhance user experience. Users can select their preferred button color using a color picker, and their choice is saved using `localStorage`. The button features a bounce animation on hover and click.

## 🧩 Features

- 🎨 Customizable button color using a native color picker
- 💾 Persistent user preferences using `localStorage`
- 🪄 Smooth bounce animation using CSS3 `@keyframes`
- 🔁 Real-time UI updates based on user input

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User selects a color** from the color picker.
2. The selected color is saved in `localStorage`.
3. When the page is reloaded, the button retains the chosen color.
4. Clicking the button triggers a visual animation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Structure of the webpage
- **CSS3** — Styling and bounce animations
- **JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage

## 📁 File Structure



project-folder/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # CSS for layout and animations
└── script.js         # JavaScript for functionality




## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Pick a color and click the button to see the animation and saved preference.

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add more animation styles.
- Include reset option for stored preferences.
- Improve mobile responsiveness.
